## Assignment Description  
You can develop a game of any genre or category, in 2D or 3D. <br>
This is an individual project, the goal is to complete a simple yet engaging game prototype.<br>
it could have an element of your own personality and interests in it, it could be a tool to teach a new concept or idea through gameified experiences, it could be a game that focuses on narrative design and tells you a story with interactive elements or it could be a turn based puzzle game where every choice within the system affects the gameplay – the game type is entirely your decision.<br>

## Additional Information   
Game Prototype as a playable standalone build (PC/Android) --> Windows

## Running the Project
Build-Maze/ mazeProject.exe

## Project Summary
This project showed me the difficulties of designing and developing a game. From the beginning everything is different, a Wizard is supposed to present the game, I think it is an animation, however, I don't know how to do it. Therefore, everything changed. The initial idea of the game was an action-adventure, which was necessary to solve puzzles to get the gems. This game only confuses you with the maze itself. It has no other riddles. For the gems, they only need to shoot an arrow to get them. There is no magician available to help the player uncover gem secrets. There are no other scenes. I did not build, the dramatic end of a great door that opens shooting an arrow of different colours. I feel like it was wasted time building this gate and "water" at MagicaVoxel. In perspective, the first mini-game I documented was written, I only kept the general idea, but the project was planned very idealistic and with a lot of imagination. That, construction becomes tremendously tricky.


## Development Process nd Testing process:
	What worked
* Player controls and camera
*	Integration of objects from MagicaVoxel.
*	Shoot: keep the camara of player and with object imports.
*	Triggers: light turn on, counting the gems collect and disappear gem collect.
*	Timer: Chronometer in the corner. Also, the integration of trigger when the time end to move to another scene.
*	Music between scenes.
*	Winner and loser menu
*	Use of features like a Pro builder and Particle systems

	What failed
-     Not disappear arrow of the maze. 
-      Not control of the player of the music. 
-      Not save and show the time when you finished the game.
-      Not change of colour of the arrow when collecting gems.
-      Not map or compass to help or guide the player on the maze.
-      Not access to the menu.
-      The game does not allow exit when in player mode. No escape button function.
